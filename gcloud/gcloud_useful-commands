gcloud config list	is a command that tells you which project and account you are using.

"gcloud compute config-ssh" makes SSHing into virtual machienes easier by adding an alias for each instance under ~/.ssh/config. Each instance will be given an alias of the form NAME.ZONE.PROJECT.

"gcloud compute copy-files" copies files between a virtual machiene instance and your local machiene. This command uses scp(1) in the background to facilitate the transfer.

"gcloud compute disks" reads and manipulates Google Compute Engine disks.

"gcloud instance-template" creates an instance template that can be used to create instances in any zone!

To see which instances are running run "gcloud compute instances list"

You can use "gcloud copute instances move" to move an instance between zones.

"gcloud auth list" shows a list of accounts you currently have available.

"gcloud config configurations list" lists all available configurations.

Use "gcloud config configurations create CONFIGURATION_NAME --no-activate" to create a new configuration.
Then use "gcloud config configurations activate CONFIGURATION_NAME" to switch to that configuration.
You can reinitialise a configuration by running "gcloud init".
I think gcloud config set may be able to do the same thing! Let's see. YES! "gcloud config set project valued-bastion-148513" worked!



FIREWALL RULES
"gcloud compute firewall-rules" can be used to list, create, update, and delete GCE firewall rules. But what firewall rules do I need to see stuff like JIRA?
