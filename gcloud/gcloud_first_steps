gcloud compute:

	gcloud compute GROUP | COMMAND [GLOBAL -FLAG ...]

Bassic help found at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/compute

(gcloud help will give a discription of flags to all commands.

A few types of GROUP are:
	networks
	firewall-rules
	machiene-types
	vpn-tunnels
	zones 
	(among MANY others!)
	
	I'm guessing this is to select which machienes you run certain commands on, although I'm not sure. You can select many attributes of the machiene and can probably choose a machiene in the overlap of two or more groups. This needs to be looked into! 

COMMAND is one of the following:

	config-ssh
	copy-files
	reset-windows-password
	ssh

	I'm not to sure what this means now. I kind of expected stuff like firewall rules to be included here with perhaps a few commands like launch instance and create, start, stop etc. I will need to investigate the GROUPS further and find out more.


UPDATE:
I now think that GLOBAL_FLAGS are what's used to select various groups of machienes whilst GROUPS and COMMAND runs various commands on the machienes.
